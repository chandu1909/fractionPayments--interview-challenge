Issues and improvisations

-> PAN must be stored in encrypted format but stored in clear


-> Internal cache concept will fail when multiple instances available as the hashmap can't be shared among
instances and duplicate transactions can happen

Sol: use REDIS and share among pods

-> calculating balance is querying entire transaction set when its 0 which is not necessary.

When Database permits :

Sol: Add a columns transaction date, transaction time to transaction table
     Add a column monthly balance and monthly billing date  to account table
     only traverse through the transaction from the day after last months billing date

-> App health is not being calculated

Sol: Need to write health logic and make application healthy and unhealthy accordingly

-> Custom Exceptions are not created
Sol :  need to create custom Exceptions
       create more dynamic response builder

-> Does not accept integer values in place of double

Sol: Well, we don't necessarily solve this as frontend will have control over what's being sent to backend

-> DAO factory pattern hasn't been used

Sol: Need to implement DAO for all database related operations
